    <string name="a7x">
A lonely road crossed another cold state line\n
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find\n
While I recall all the words you spoke to me\n
Can\'t help, but wish that I was there\n
Back where I\'d love to be, oh, yeah\n
\n
Dear God, the only thing I ask of you is\n
To hold her when I\'m not around\n
When I\'m much too far away\n
We all need that person who can be true to you\n
But I left her when I found her\n
And now I wish I\'d stayed\n
\'Cause I\'m lonely and I\'m tired\n
I\'m missing you again, oh, no\n
Once again\n
\n
There\'s nothing here for me on this barren road\n
There\'s no one here while the city sleeps\n
And all the shops are closed\n
Can\'t help, but think of the times I\'ve had with you\n
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh, yeah\n
\n
Dear God, the only thing I ask of you is\n
To hold her when I\'m not around\n
When I\'m much too far away\n
We all need that person who can be true to you\n
But I left her when I found her\n
And now I wish I\'d stayed\n
\'Cause I\'m lonely and I\'m tired\n
I\'m missing you again, oh, no\n
Once again\n
\n
Some search, never finding a way\n
Before long, they waste away\n
I found you, something told me to stay\n
I gave in to selfish ways\n
And how I miss someone to hold\n
When hope begins to fade\n
\n
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line\n
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find\n

Thanks for all you\'ve done\n
I\'ve missed you for so long\n
I can\'t believe you\'re gone\n
You still live in me\n
I feel you in the wind\n
You guide me constantly\n
\n
I never knew what it was\n
To be alone, no\n
\'Cause you were always\n
There for me\n
You were always waiting\n
But now I come home\n
\n
And I miss your face so\n
Smiling down on me\n
I close my eyes to see\n
\n
And I know\n
You\'re a part of me\n
And it\'s your song\n
That sets me free\n
I sing it while\n
I feel I can\'t hold on\n
I sing tonight\n
\'Cause it comforts me\n
\n
I carry the things\n
That remind me of you\n
In loving memory of\n
The one that was so true\n
You were as kind as you could be\n
And even though you\'re gone\n
You still mean the world to me\n
\n
I never knew what it was\n
To be alone, no\n
\'Cause you were always\n
There for me\n
You were always waiting\n
But now I come home\n
\n
And it\'s not the same no\n
It feels empty and alone\n
I can\'t believe you\'re gone\n
\n
And I know\n
You\'re a part of me\n
And it\'s your song\n
That sets me free\n
I sing it while\n
I feel I can\'t hold on\n
I sing tonight\n
\'Cause it comforts me\n
\n
I\'m glad he set you free from sorrow\n
But I\'ll still love you more tomorrow\n
And you\'ll be here\n
With me still\n
All you did you did with feeling\n
And you always found a meaning\n
And you always will\n
And you always will\n
And you always will\n
\n
And I know\n
You\'re a part of me\n
And it\'s your song\n
That sets me free\n
I sing it while\n
I feel I can\'t hold on\n
I sing tonight\n
\'Cause it comforts me\n

Load up on guns, bring your friends\n
It\'s fun to lose and to pretend\n
She\'s over-bored and self-assured\n

A mosquito, my libido\n
Yeah, yey\n

I\'m worse at what I do best\n
And for this gift I feel blessed\n

        Who\'s to say\n
        What\'s impossible?\n
        Well they forgot\n
        This world keeps spinning\n
        And with each new day\n
        I can feel a change in everything\n
        And as the surface breaks reflections fade\n
        But in some ways they remain the same\n
        And as my mind begins to spread its wings\n
        There\'s no stopping in curiosity\n
        \n
        I wanna turn the whole thing upside down\n
        I\'ll find the things they say just can\'t be found\n
        I\'ll share this love I find with everyone\n
        We\'ll sing and dance to mother nature\'s songs\n
        I don\'t want this feeling to go away\n
        \n
        Who\'s to say I can\'t do everything?\n
        Well I can try, and as I roll along I begin to find\n
        Things aren\'t always just what they seem\n
        \n
        I want to turn the whole thing upside down\n
        I\'ll find the things they say just can\'t be found\n
        I\'ll share this love I find with everyone\n
        We\'ll sing and dance to mother nature\'s songs\n
        \n
        This world keeps spinning\n
        And there\'s no time to waste\n
        Well it all keeps spinning spinning\n
        Round and round and upside down\n
        \n
        Who\'s to say what\'s impossible and can\'t be found?\n
        I don\'t want this feeling to go away\n
        \n
        Please don\'t go away (3x)\n
        \n
        Is this how it\'s supposed to be? (2x)\n

Lay beside me\n
Tell me what they\'ve done\n
Speak the words I wanna hear\n
To make my demons run\n
The door is locked now\n
But it\'s open if you\'re true\n
If you can understand me\n
Then I can understand you\n
\n
Lay beside me\n
Under wicked sky\n
Through black of day\n
Dark of night\n
We share this paralyze\n
The door cracks open\n
But there\'s no sun shining through\n
Black heart scarring darker still\n
But there\'s no sun shining through\n
No, there\'s no sun shining through\n
No, there\'s no sun shining\n
\n
What I\'ve felt\n
What I\'ve known\n
Turn the pages\n
Turn to stone\n
Behind the door\n
Should I open it for you?\n
\n
Yeah\n
What I\'ve felt\n
What I\'ve known\n
Sick and tired\n
I stand alone\n
Could you be there?\n
\'Cause I\'m the one who waits for you\n
Or are you unforgiven too?\n
\n
Come lay beside me\n
This won\'t hurt, I swear\n
She loves me not\n
She loves me still\n
But she\'ll never love again\n
She lay beside me\n
But she\'ll be there when I\'m gone\n
Black heart scarring darker still\n
Yes, she\'ll be there when I\'m gone\n
Yes, she\'ll be there when I\'m gone\n
Dead, sure she\'ll be there\n
\n
What I\'ve felt\n
What I\'ve known\n
Turn the pages\n
Turn to stone\n
Behind the door\n
Should I open it for you?\n

Yeah\n

What I\'ve known\n
Sick and tired\n
I stand alone\n
Could you be there?\n
\'Cause I\'m the one who waits for you\n
Or are you unforgiven too?\n
\n
Lay beside me\n
Tell me what I\'ve done\n
The door is closed, so are your eyes\n
But now I see the sun\n
Now I see the sun\n
Yes, now I see it\n

Turn to stone\n
Behind the door\n
Should I open it for you?\n

Oh, what I\'ve felt\n
Oh, what I\'ve known\n
I take this key\n
And I bury it in you\n
Because you\'re unforgiven too\n
\n
Never free\n
Never me\n
\'Cause you\'re unforgiven too\n
Oh\n
